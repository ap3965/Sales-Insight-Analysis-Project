# Sales Insights-Data Analysis Project

The objective of this project is to create an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Power Bi. The dashboard is designed to help you see the sales data visually and take wise decisions based on what you learn. The project's data was stored in a MySQL database, which consists of several tables related to one another.  

The screenshots below provide a short overview of the project's outcome and final appearance.
